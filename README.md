In the first task Calculate Factorial Using a Function 
I am used recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number.Input( ) function is used to reads value from the user.
In these case if the given value is 0 or 1 it returns 1 only and other than 0 or 1 it will go to else block and performs continuos functions until the condition is false.
And finally the result is printed with the help of print() funtion.

In the second task  Using the Math Module for Calculations
Input() function is used to read values from the user and math module is used to calculate the squareroot,log,sine value etc...
To import math module we use the synatx is import modulename i.e import math
To calculate square root we use math.sqrt(given value)
To calculate Logarithm we use math.log(given value)
To calculate sine value we use math.sin(given value)
And finally it prints the result with the help of print() function
